This progect uses the data from the website Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinxbe/wnba-player-stats-2017) regarding the statistics of female basketball players who competed in the 2016-2017 season in the WNBA, the women's NBA league.
The file is in csv format and without editing it, it consists of 143 observations and 32 variables. Each observation corresponds to a different athlete.
After initial data processing, one observation with some missing values was removed and 3 variables were added. Two of the three new variables categorize quantitative variables, and the third converts a five-class categorical to a two-class categorical.
Therefore, after cleaning the data we have a set with 142 observations and 35 variables.
